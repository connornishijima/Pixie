This library also contains a Pixie EAGLE library (In "extras/hardware") for adding Pixies into your own PCB layouts!

----------
# Arduino Library Installation

**With Arduino Library Manager:** ***(Stable - RECOMMENDED)***

1. Open *Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries* in the Arduino IDE.
2. Search for "Pixie" by Connor Nishijima, and select the latest version.
3. Click the Install button and Arduino will prepare the library and examples for you!

**Manual Install:** (Hourly Builds)

1. Click "Clone or Download" above to get an "Pixie-master.zip" file.
2. Extract its contents to the libraries folder in your Arduino sketchbook. ("C:/Users/**YOUR_USERNAME**/Documents/Arduino/libraries" on Windows)
3. Rename the folder from "Pixie-master" to "Pixie".

# Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/connornishijima/Pixie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/connornishijima/Pixie)

Pixie for Arduino is automatically tested with Travis CI against:
- ATmega328p (Uno)
- ATmega2560 (Mega)
- ATmega32u4 (Leonardo)
- ESP8266
- ESP32

*Currently untested are STM/Cortex or SAMD platforms such as the Teensy 3+ and Arduino MKR.*

Is it marked "Failing"? **No worries!** If you install Pixie using the Arduino Library Manager, you'll be getting the latest stable release. *This GitHub repo is under frequent changes, and some of these changes may be breaking at times.*
